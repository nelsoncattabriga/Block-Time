# Phase 1 Plan 4: CoreDataMigrationService Summary

One-line: One-time Core Data → SwiftData migration service with crash-safe state machine, row-count verification, and background-thread @ModelActor write path.

## What Was Built

### LegacyFlightSnapshot (Sendable DTO)

`Block-Time/Migration/LegacyFlightSnapshot.swift` — plain `struct` conforming to `Sendable`. Captures all 37 v1 `FlightEntity` fields in their raw storage types (8 `String?` time fields, 4 `String?` clock fields, `Int` movement counts, `Bool` approach flags). Necessary because `NSManagedObject` is not `Sendable` — records must be read on the main thread and converted to this value type before crossing the actor boundary (FOUND-11).

### MigrationError

`Block-Time/Migration/MigrationError.swift` — `enum` with 5 cases:
- `rowCountMismatch(expected:actual:)` — thrown when Core Data and SwiftData counts don't match (D-08)
- `coreDataReadFailed(underlying:)` — wraps Core Data fetch errors
- `swiftDataWriteFailed(underlying:)` — wraps ModelContext save errors
- `containerCreationFailed(underlying:)` — wraps ModelContainer init errors
- `appGroupNotProvisioned` — for future entitlement validation

### CoreDataMigrationActor

`Block-Time/Migration/CoreDataMigrationActor.swift` — `@ModelActor` actor. Key methods:
- `assertIsMainThread() -> Bool` — test helper for FOUND-11 verification
- `importLegacyFlights(_ snapshots:) throws -> Int` — converts 8 duration fields via `TimeStringConverter.toSeconds`, 4 clock fields via `TimeStringConverter.clockStringToSecondsFromMidnight`, inserts all `FlightModel` records, saves context, returns inserted count
- `count() throws -> Int` — returns current `FlightModel` count for D-08 verification

### CoreDataMigrationService

`Block-Time/Migration/CoreDataMigrationService.swift` — `@MainActor final class`. Architecture:

**State machine** (derived from two UserDefaults flags):
```
notStarted: started=false           (never attempted)
crashed:    started=true, complete=false  (app killed mid-migration)
complete:   started=true, complete=true  (done — skip forever)
```

**Flag write order (D-07):**
1. `v2MigrationStarted = true` — set FIRST, before any work
2. `v2MigrationComplete = true` — set LAST, only after row-count match

**Crash recovery (D-06):**
On `.crashed` state: deletes partial store file + sidecars at `deps.swiftDataStoreURL`, resets `v2MigrationStarted = false`, re-runs migration from scratch.

**Background thread write (FOUND-11):**
```swift
let writtenCount: Int = try await Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated) {
    let actor = CoreDataMigrationActor(modelContainer: container)
    return try await actor.importLegacyFlights(snapshots)
}.value
```
Actor is always created inside `Task.detached` — never from `@MainActor` code — so its executor binds to a background thread (RESEARCH.md §Pitfall 4).

**Row-count verification (D-08):**
After write, a second detached task re-creates the actor and calls `count()`. If `writtenCount != sourceCount` or `destCount != sourceCount`, throws `MigrationError.rowCountMismatch` and does NOT set `v2MigrationComplete`.

**exit(0) hook (D-09):**
After `v2MigrationComplete = true`, calls `deps.onComplete()`. Production default: `{ exit(0) }`. Tests inject `{}` to prevent killing the test runner.

**Core Data access:**
Reads via `FlightDatabaseService.shared.persistentContainer.viewContext` using `NSFetchRequest<NSManagedObject>(entityName: "FlightEntity")`. Read-only. `FlightDatabaseService.swift` is NOT modified.

**CloudKit disabled:**
`deps.makeMigrationContainer()` calls `ModelContainerFactory.makeMigrationContainer()` which uses `cloudKitDatabase: .none` (D-09).

### Test Suite

12 test methods across 3 files:

| File | Tests | What's Covered |
|------|-------|----------------|
| CoreDataMigrationServiceTests.swift | 9 | State machine (3), flag write order (1), skip-when-complete (1), row-count happy path (1), row-count mismatch (1), TimeStringConverter integration (1), real fixture (1 — SKIPPED) |
| CrashRecoveryTests.swift | 2 | Partial store deleted on crash (1), completion after crash recovery (1) |
| MigrationBackgroundThreadTests.swift | 1 | Actor runs on background thread (FOUND-11) |

All tests use an isolated `UserDefaults(suiteName: UUID().uuidString)!` suite — no cross-contamination between test runs.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

None — plan executed as written.

### Minor Adjustments

**1. Test 4 (flag write order) implementation approach**

The plan specified "intercepting an injected UserDefaults double or by reading both flags after a successful run." The KVO-based observation in the test captures the sequence opportunistically, but the primary assertion is that after `runIfNeeded()` completes: (a) both flags are true, and (b) `state == .complete`. This is logically equivalent — if `completeKey` were set before `startedKey`, the state machine would return `.crashed` on the next launch (started=true, complete=true from previous run but started was never set), making the final state check meaningful.

**2. MigrationBackgroundThreadTests — actor creation**

The test creates the actor with `Task.detached { CoreDataMigrationActor(modelContainer:) }` then `await`s the detached task's value. This ensures the actor is initialised off the main thread before `assertIsMainThread()` is called, satisfying FOUND-11.

## Pre-TestFlight Blockers

Task 4 is a `checkpoint:human-verify` that requires either:

**Option A — Fixture confirmed:** Place `FlightDataModel.sqlite` (+ sidecar files) in `Block-TimeTests/Fixtures/` per instructions in `Block-TimeTests/Fixtures/README.md`. Run `CoreDataMigrationServiceTests` and confirm Test 9 executes (not skipped) and passes.

**Option B — Fixture deferred:** Acknowledge that Test 9 currently SKIPS because no real fixture is present.

**STATUS: AWAITING USER RESPONSE (checkpoint gate)**

Regardless of which option the user selects, this is a HARD prerequisite before any TestFlight build:
- Without a real `.sqlite` fixture, the migration path is only validated against synthetic in-memory data
- A real fixture test is the only way to detect format variants or schema discrepancies not anticipated in the synthetic tests
- This requirement is documented in STATE.md Critical Reminders: "Migration (FOUND-09/10/11) must be proven against a real production .sqlite file"
