  3. MINIMUM REST BETWEEN DUTIES

  3A. Standard Rest Formula

  Rule Reference: FD18.1 (Planning) & FD28.1 (Operational)

  If Previous Duty ≤12 hours:
  - Formula: MAX(10 hours, previous duty length)
  - Examples:
    - 8hr duty → 10hrs rest
    - 10hr duty → 10hrs rest
    - 12hr duty → 12hrs rest

  If Previous Duty >12 hours:
  - Formula: 12 + (1.5 × hours over 12)
  - Examples:
    - 13hr → 12 + (1.5 × 1) = 13.5hrs
    - 14hr → 12 + (1.5 × 2) = 15hrs
    - 15hr → 12 + (1.5 × 3) = 16.5hrs
    - 16hr → 12 + (1.5 × 4) = 18hrs

  3B. Reduced Rest (Operational Only)

  Example:
  - 6hr flight + 6hr rest + 4hr flight = 16hr total duty
  - Discount: 50% × 6hrs = 3hrs
  - Calculate next rest as: 13hr duty → 12 + (1.5 × 1) = 13.5hrs

  Rule Reference: FD17.4 & FD27.4 - Exception
  - If rest period includes 2300-0530:
