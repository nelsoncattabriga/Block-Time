  Since you only save to the internal logbook now, you may want to:                                     
  1. Remove the LogbookDestination enum entirely, or keep only .internalLogbook                         
  2. Remove the logbookDestination property and related functions                                       
  3. Remove the URL scheme from Info.plist                                                              
  4. Clean up the CloudKit and migration code                                                           
                                                                                                        
  Would you like me to remove these remaining references?
